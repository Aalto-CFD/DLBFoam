# Foam-Aalto: LoadBalancedChemistryModel
![OpenFOAM 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenFOAM-8-brightgreen)

An OpenFOAM chemistry model introducing dynamic load balancing for chemistry calculation
in parallel simulations.

## Why do I need this?

Load imbalance in parallel reactive simulations is an issue that causes very long
simulation times in OpenFOAM simulations utilizing finite-rate chemistry.

LoadBalancedChemistryModel introduces runtime load balancing through MPI routines
to minimize the load imbalance between ranks and gain speed-up. The implementation
details can be found in [[1]](#1).

## Compilation

LoadBalancedChemistryModel does not require any third-party dependency.
After sourcing OpenFOAM-8, simply execute:

```
./Allwmake
```

## Usage

Check the tutorials given in tutorials folder.

## Citation

If you use our model, please cite the publication describing its implementation [[1]](#1).
