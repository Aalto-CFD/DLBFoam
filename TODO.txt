- Fix Allwclean

- remove 0dtest

- make pyjac2foam such that it provides single dir with everything:
    - print out example include format for openfoam

- remove unnecessary dependencies from applications/solvers.

- add etc/controlDict example and perhaps shipped mechanisms

- Fix the pyjac compilation optimization everywehere to Ofast and march.

- Add explanation of possible linking error in README
chemFoam: symbol lookup error: /path/to/user/OpenFoam/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libchemistryModel_DLB.so: undefined symbol: eval_h

- make a safety check of library linking as introduced in pyJacLoadBalancedChemistryModel.C constructor.

- Make a safety check that CONP is defined and pyjac mechanism is generated in constant pressure mode. 

- library run-time naming could be different "_pyjac" in everything too much?

- Add cmake as a requirement in README -- could be avoided in a long run as well
