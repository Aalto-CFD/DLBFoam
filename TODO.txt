- Fix Allwclean

- Allwmake OF check does not support -dev : "integer error"

- README mechanism choice needs to be re-written. First introduce  general requirements, 
then introduce ct2foam and lastly the examples.

- remove 0dtest

- remove rankbased figure to a separate doc folder

- Fix README controldict example with unified ct2foam output

- README has lot of debian based assumption (bashrc references etc.)

- make pyjac2foam such that it provides single dir with everything:
    - print out example include format for openfoam

- remove unnecessary dependencies from applications/solvers.

- add etc/controlDict example and perhaps shipped mechanisms

- Fix the pyjac compilation optimization everywehere to Ofast and march.

- Add explanation of possible linking error in README
chemFoam: symbol lookup error: /path/to/user/OpenFoam/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libchemistryModel_DLB.so: undefined symbol: eval_h

- make a safety check of library linking as introduced in pyJacLoadBalancedChemistryModel.C constructor.

- Make a safety check that CONP is defined and pyjac mechanism is generated in constant pressure mode. 

- library run-time naming could be different "_pyjac" in everything too much?

- Add cmake as a requirement in README -- could be avoided in a long run as well



commit: "Added error control for Allwmake considering MKL/OpenBLAS installation checks. Furthermore, README 
is updated to avoid non-general references to debian systems or CSC cluster."
